This project aims at providing a simple library to ease the process of mapping objects or beans from one design layer to another design layer, using annotations.
One can specify mappings both in source class (Sink Annotation) and target class(Source Annotation).
Supports mapping composed user class objects and array fields.

It is NOT an ORM Framework like Hibernate, but it facilitates object to object mapping between different design layers.
So, say if hibernate or axis generates DTO's and you want to map them to your own beans , so at that point this framework can be used.
