Omapper is a simple library which provides utilities to transform java beans from one design layer to another.
Say for example ,
you have a legacy application which has some java beans like Customer, Account etc.
And while adding another access layer like web services, it would again have some bean with same structure and data as the backend application.
So , as a result we have two similar classes.
Now , while communicating between different layers , we write a error prone transformation logic which comprises of multiple chained get and set operations.
For Example:
There is a business layer which has a bean called CustomerBean_BS :
{{{
   CustomerBean_BS {
      String name;
      String address;
      int age;         
}


}}}

And similarly web service layer above that also exposes a bean called 
CustomerBean_WS with exactlys ame structure as BS one:

{{{
   CustomerBean_WS {
      String name;
      String address;
      int age;         
}


}}}
